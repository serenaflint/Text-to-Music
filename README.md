# Text-to-Music
Project for UB Hacking 2019

Testing was done on several files, here are some of the selected examples. 

* Files designated with <i>bee</i> were created from the Bee Movie script.
* Files designated with <i>seals</i> were created from the Navy Seals copypasta.
* Files designated with <i>scp</i> were created from entry 049 of our SCP Foundation Bot created last week at DandyHacks.
* Files designated with <i>test</i> were created with a file I honestly don't remember, but it was probably another SCP.

To listen to the results of the text conversation BEFORE being run through Watson, try:
<ul>
  <li>bee-before.mp3</li>
  <li>seals-before.mp3</li>
  <li>scp-before.mp3<li>
  <li>test-before.mp3</li>
</ul>

Then, to listen to the results of the conversion AFTER being run through Watson, try:
<ul>
  <li>bee.mp3</li>
  <li>seals.mp3</li>
  <li>scp.mp3<li>
  <li>test.mp3</li>
</ul>
