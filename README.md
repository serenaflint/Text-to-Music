Project for UB Hacking 2019

**************************************************************************************************************************
<b>Testing was done on several files, here are some of the selected examples. </b>

* Files designated with <i>bee</i> were created from the Bee Movie script.
* Files designated with <i>seals</i> were created from the Navy Seals copypasta.
* Files designated with <i>scp</i> were created from entry 049 of our SCP Foundation Bot created last week at DandyHacks.
* Files designated with <i>test</i> were created with a file I honestly don't remember, but it was probably another SCP.

<b>To listen to the results of the text conversation <i>BEFORE</i> being run through Watson, try:</b>

  <li>seals-before.mp3</li>
  <li>scp-before.mp3</li>
  <li>test-before.mp3</li>
</ul>

<b>Then, to listen to the results of the conversion <i>AFTER</i> being run through Watson, try:</b>
<ul>
  <li>bee.mp3</li>
  <li>seals.mp3</li>
  <li>scp.mp3</li>
  <li>test.mp3</li>
